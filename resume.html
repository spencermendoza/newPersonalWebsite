					<h3>Web Developer | 2017 - Present</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Made this personal website (several times over) using HTML and CSS and various flexbox solutions, plus a teaspoon of Javascript. Choosing a color scheme and layout took a while due to the huge number of design influences I look at daily. I wanted this site to be a good representation of my personality but also a showcase of my work and ideas.</p></li>
						<li><p>Made a website for a local family owned business which included color coordination, menus (literal menus, the business was a hookah cafe that sold food/coffee as well), and overall navigation into five distinct pages using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.</p></li>
						<li><p>Created a webapp using Javascript for use in the tabletop role playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The app allows users to maintain and keep a list of iniatiative order during combat situations. The app makes it easy for users to list initiative, armor class, damage, health, and health remaining for each of the combat participants, as well as sort the list by any of those categories. Any of these items can be edited through the list itself without having to remove and re-add any combatants. Finally, users can easily add or remove new combatants or enemies as well.</p></li>
