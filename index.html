				<h3 id='this'>I am a 25 year old Web Developer currently living with my girlfriend in Gwinnett County, Georgia. I love my girlfriend, my Jeep, and my dogs. Here are a few photos of my life and the things that are important to me!</h3>

						<a href="img/photos/hayandme.JPG">

							<p>This is my girlfriend Hayley and I. We took this picture back in August on a cruise through the Carribbean. We look pretty damn good if you ask me!</p>
						</a>
					</li>

						<a href="img/photos/boomer.jpg">
							<img src="img/photos/boomer.jpg" alt="" class="rotate">
							<p>This is me and Boomer. He's a long-haired chihuahua. He's really Hayley's dog but I love him anyway even though he barks like it's going out of style.</p>
						</a>
					</li>

						<a href="img/photos/creasyandstan1.JPEG">
							<img src="img/photos/creasyandstan1.JPEG" alt="" class="rotate">
							<p>These are my parents dogs, Stanley and Creasy. They're both rescues but we think Stanley is a Standard Dachsund mixed with some other dog and Creasy is an American Staffordshire Terrier. Even though they're my parents dogs, I take every opportunity I can get to visit them and take them to the dog park or on walks.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="img/photos/creasy2.jpg">
							<img src="img/photos/creasy2.jpg" alt="" class="rotate">
							<p>Creasy is a little over two years old but she still thinks she can fit into all the smaller spots she used to fit into when she was a baby.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/hayandmecon.jpg">
							<img src="img/photos/hayandmecon.jpg" alt="">
							<p>This is Hayley and I at DragonCon this year. We go every single year. I'm pretty nerdy and Hayley likes to tell people that I drag her along every year but I know that secretly she loves it and looks forward to going every year.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/creasy1.JPEG">
							<img src="img/photos/creasy1.JPEG" alt="">
							<p>Creasy is a little more photogenic than Stanley is!</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/creasy3.jpg">
							<img src="img/photos/creasy3.jpg" alt="" class="rotate">
							<p>In typical Am Staff fashion, Creasy absolutely does not like to be left alone and will follow anyone around the entire house, she even likes to lay between my moms legs while she's doing dishes!</p>
						</a>
					</li>					
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/jeep.jpg">
							<img src="img/photos/jeep.jpg" alt="" class="rotate">
							<p>This is my pride and joy, my Jeep! It's a 2013 Wrangler Sport and was completely stock when I first bought it. I put a lot of time and work into building it up to where it is now and I wouldn't have it any other way! I don't get to take it four-wheeling as often as I would like so mall-crawling will have to do.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/creasyandstan2.JPG">
							<img src="img/photos/creasyandstan2.JPG" alt="">
							<p>Here is another picture of Stanley and Creasy. Even though Stanley is an old fart (he's 12 years old now), he's still in charge and gets all the good spots on the couch.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li class="twoWide">
						<a href="img/photos/creasyandjeep.JPG">
							<img src="img/photos/creasyandjeep.JPG" alt="">
							<p>I want to say that Creasy likes taking rides in my Jeep with me when the top is down, but I think she really just likes car rides in general.</p>
